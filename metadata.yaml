description: It was a season of unequalled prosperity in Devil's Ford. The half a
  dozen cabins scattered along the banks of the North Fork, as if by some overflow
  of that capricious river, had become augmented during a week of fierce excitement
  by twenty or thirty others, that were huddled together on the narrow gorge of Devil's
  Spur, or cast up on its steep sides. So sudden and violent had been the change of
  fortune, that the dwellers in the older cabins had not had time to change with it,
  but still kept their old habits, customs, and even their old clothes. The flour
  pan in which their daily bread was mixed stood on the rude table side by side with
  the "prospecting pans", half full of gold washed up from their morning's work; the
  front windows of the newer tenements looked upon the one single thoroughfare, but
  the back door opened upon the uncleared wilderness, still haunted by the misshapen
  bulk of bear or the nightly gliding of catamount.
